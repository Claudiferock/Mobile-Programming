# RN02: Number guessing game
Number guessing game (between 1 - 100), that hints if you guessed too high or too low. When you finally guess the number, you are told how many tries it took you to guess it right.  
Since on React Native there's no support for linear gradients yet I used React-Native's ImageBackground component to use a gradient background. Also, I noticed that the app even accepts mathematical operations as a guessed number.
